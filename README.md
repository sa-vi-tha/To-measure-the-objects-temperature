 Thermal Object Detection and Temperature Mapping with YOLOv8


This project demonstrates real-time object detection using the YOLOv8 model, combined with a simulated thermal imaging feature to map and display approximate temperatures for detected objects. 
It’s an innovative blend of computer vision and thermal visualization, perfect for applications like safety monitoring, industrial inspections, or smart surveillance systems.

🚀 Features
Real-Time Object Detection: Uses the pre-trained YOLOv8n model to detect and classify objects in live video.
Thermal Mapping: Simulates thermal imaging with grayscale-to-color heatmap conversion using OpenCV.
Temperature Calculation: Maps average thermal intensity values of detected regions to approximate temperatures.
Visualization: Displays both the object detection frame and thermal heatmap in real-time.


🛡️ Use Cases
Safety and surveillance systems.
Industrial monitoring for heat anomalies.
Innovative research projects integrating AI and thermal imaging.
